### Background

PDF ebooks usually have table of content (TOC). Hence, the texts in a PDF ebook are naturally in a certain hierarchy. Such text and hierarchy information extracted from PDF ebooks can be used for research in machine learning (especially hierarchical text classification) and natural language processing.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool to manage and maintain a huge database of texts extracted from PDF ebooks and allow users to access and upload data through RESTful API endpoints. This project enable easy sharing and hence facilitates collaboration among researchers in a team, or across different teams.

### Project Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide a RESTful backend and an admin site to 

* Organize and manage PDF ebooks
* Extract TOC hierarchy and section texts from PDF ebooks
* Store all data extracted from PDF ebooks in relational databases
* Access the TOC, text and more through a handlful of RESTful APIs
* Post your own version of processed texts of a book/chapter and share with other researchers
* (*Optional) clean up and lemmatize the extracted texts using the built-in cleaner.

### Skills & Tools Required

* **[Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat.html) (2015 DC or later) is required** to pre-process the PDF files and convert them into HTML files split by bookmarks. The PDF and HTML files will be then fed into the system.
* **Adequate knowledge of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is required** to be able to maintain and further expand this project. Please make sure you understand Django well enough before reading the rest of this document.
* Due to copyright issues, we cannot distribute PDF ebooks or any processed text extracted from them. This project contents only the source code, without any database or files. You are supposed to setup your own database and connent to it before running the system.

### Text Cleaning Techniques

The built-in cleaner can perform the following operations sequentially on the extracted texts:

1. Perform known replacements (e.g. "ﬁ" --> "fi"; if you don't see any difference, try to copy the first "ﬁ" as TWO letters, "f" and "i". You will realize you can't, because "ﬁ" is actually ONE unicode character)
1. Replace non-ascii characters with underscore ("_")
1. Remove all URIs
1. Remove all emails
1. Remove stop words according the the MySQL stop word list
1. Remove all punctuation marks
1. Remove all digits
1. Remove one-letter and two-letter words
1. Remove redundant whitespace characters
1. Lemmatize

However, the cleaner is **NOT enabled by default**. You may manually enable the cleaner or customize the cleaning procedure by modifying the source code in the `extractor` package.


## <a name="system-setup" style="color: #000;"></a> Getting Started

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. Clone the project
1. Install python dependencies: </br> `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Download [WordNet data for NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/data.html)
1. Setup your own database and update the connection configuration in `settings.py`, then migrate.
1. Run the development server <br> `$ python3 manage.py runserver`

The following additional steps are **for Ubuntu users ONLY**:

1. Install package `libjpeg-dev` </br> `$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev`
1. Install package `libfreetype6-dev` </br> `$ sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev`
1. Reinstall `pillow` </br> `$ pip uninstall pillow`</br> `$ pip install pillow`


## <a name="admin-site" style="color: #000;"></a> Admin Site

This is a standard admin site of Django. It can be accessed by the URL `<your-domain>/admin/`. If you are running the default Django development server, the complete URL is [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/).

You may need to create a superuser for the first time to log in to the admin site. This can be done by

```bash
$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

If you didn't know about this yet, please learn Django first before trying the following steps. See [Introduction](#intro).

### Create an Entry for the `Book` Model

The following fields are required to create a new entry.

| Field | Explanation  
| --- | --- 
| Title | The title of the PDF book 
| Toc html path | The full path of the html file generated by Adobe Acrobat that contains the table of content*.

**\*NOTE**: There must be a directory of the same name next to the html fie. This is the default output format of Adobe Acrobat when converting PDF to HTML with the "Split by Bookmarks" option turned on. e.g.

### Process a Book

After creating a `Book` entry,

1. Go back to the model page `/admin/book/book`
1. Tick the book that was newly created
1. Select "Process book" in the "Action" dropdown menu
1. Click "GO"

This will take from a few seconds to a few minutes for most cases, depending on the structure and the length of the book. It will take a lot longer to process a book if you enable the text cleaner. 

Most importantly, <mark>DO NOT close the browser tab or shut down the server while a book is being processed</mark>. Data integrity could NOT be preserved (in other words, the system WILL fail) if the process is interrupted in the middle.

You can view the progress in the terminal where you started the Django server.


## <a name="api" style="color: #000;"></a> RESTful API

### Overview

The docs and an emulated client are available at `http://<your-domain>/docs/`

The root URL of all RESTful APIs is `/api/v1` (e.g. the book-list api is at `http://<your-admin>/api/v1/book/list/`). There are four sub-groups of API endpoints: `Book`, `Section`, `Version` and `Content`.

| Group | URL |
| --- | --- | 
| [Book](#api-book) | `/book` 
| [Section](#api-section) | `/section`
| [Version](#api-version) | `/version`
| [Content](#api-content) | `/content`

### <a name="api-book" style="color: #000;"></a> Book

| Endpoint | URL | Method | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| [List](#book-list) | `/list/` | GET |
