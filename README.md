### Background

PDF ebooks usually have table of content (TOC). Hence, the texts in a PDF ebook are naturally in a certain hierarchy. Such text and hierarchy information extracted from PDF ebooks can be used for research in machine learning (especially hierarchical text classification) and natural language processing.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool to manage and maintain a huge database of texts extracted from PDF ebooks and allow users to access and upload versioned data through RESTful API endpoints. This framework enables easy sharing of text data and boosts collaborations among researchers in a team, or across different teams.

### Project Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide a RESTful backend and an admin site to 

* Organize and manage PDF ebooks
* Extract TOC hierarchy and section texts from PDF ebooks
* Store all data extracted from PDF ebooks in relational databases
* Access the TOC, text and more through a handlful of RESTful APIs
* Post your own version of processed texts of a book/chapter and share it with other researchers
* (*Optional) clean up and lemmatize the extracted texts using the built-in cleaner.

### Skills & Tools Required

* **[Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat.html) (2015 DC or later) is required** to pre-process the PDF files, delete useless pages/chapters, update/correct bookmarks, and convert them into HTML files split by bookmarks. The PDF and HTML files will be then fed into the system.
* **Adequate knowledge of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is required** to be able to maintain and further expand this project. Please make sure you understand Django well enough before reading the rest of this document.
* Due to copyright issues, we cannot distribute PDF ebooks or any processed text extracted from them. This project contents only the source code, without any database or files. You are supposed to setup your own database and connent django to it before running the system.

### Text Cleaning Techniques

The built-in cleaner performs the following operations sequentially on the extracted texts:

1. Perform known replacements (e.g. "ﬁ" -> "fi"; if you don't see any difference, try to copy the first "ﬁ" as TWO letters, "f" and "i". You will realize you can't, because "ﬁ" is actually ONE unicode character).
1. Fix broken line-joins (e.g. "fric- tion" -> "friction").
1. Remove redundent newline and space.
1. Remove duplicate paragraphs.
1. Remove other obvious noises generated by Acrobat Pro.

The following built-in features in `Cleaner` are **NOT enabled by default**. You may manually customize the cleaning procedure by modifying the source code in the `extractor` package.

1. Replace non-ascii characters with underscore ("_")
1. Remove all URIs
1. Remove all emails
1. Remove stop words according the the MySQL stop word list
1. Remove all punctuation marks
1. Remove all digits
1. Remove one-letter and two-letter words
1. Lemmatize


## <a name="system-setup" style="color: #000;"></a> Getting Started

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. Clone the project
1. Install python dependencies: </br> `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Setup your own database and update the connection configuration in `settings.py`, then migrate.
1. Run the development server <br> `$ python3 manage.py runserver`
1. (*Optional) Download [WordNet data for NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/data.html)

## <a name="admin-site" style="color: #000;"></a> Admin Site

### Create Superuser

This is a standard admin site of Django. It can be accessed by the URL `<your-domain>/admin/`. If you are running the default Django development server, the complete URL is [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/).

You may need to create a superuser for the first time to log in to the admin site. This can be done by

```bash
$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

If you didn't know about this yet, please learn Django first before trying the following steps. See [Introduction](#intro).

### User Groups and Object-level Permission Control

Before creating any normal user, you must create a user group in Django `Group` model with ONLY the following permissions for each model:

* book | book | Can change book
* section | section | Can change section
* ontent | content | Can add content
* content | content | Can change content
* content | content | Can delete content
* version | version | Can add version
* version | version | Can change version
* version | version | Can delete version

When creating a normal user, tick "Staff status" and select the user group above. Then the new user can access a special admin site with object-level permission control. Such user ("normal user") can only view the models, and update/delete the entries they own (e.g. the version/content they created).

### Create an Entry for the `Book` Model

The following fields are required to create a new entry.

| Field | Explanation  
| --- | --- 
| Title | The title of the PDF book 
| Toc html path | The full path of the html file generated by Adobe Acrobat that contains the table of content*.

**\*NOTE**: There must be a directory of the same name next to the html fie. This is the default output format of Adobe Acrobat when converting PDF to HTML with the "Split by Bookmarks" option turned on. e.g.

### Process a Book

After creating a `Book` entry,

1. Go back to the model page `/admin/book/book`
1. Tick the book that was newly created
1. Select "Process book" in the "Action" dropdown menu
1. Click "GO"

This will take from a few seconds to a few minutes for most cases, depending on the structure and the length of the book, and the time complexity of the text cleaning techniques.

You may browse other pages, or add another book, once you clicked "GO". You can always go back to the book list page and visually check the "is processed" flag to determine whether the processing of a newly added book is completed. Also, you can view the progress in the terminal where you started the Django server.


## <a name="api" style="color: #000;"></a> RESTful API

### Overview

The docs and an emulated client are available at `http://<your-domain>/docs/`

Only authenticated users can access any of the APIs. By default, only Basic Authentication and Session Authentication are enabled in `settings.py`. However, you may customize the authentication process to include more authentication methods.

The root URL of all RESTful APIs is `/api/v1` (e.g. the book-list api is at `http://<your-admin>/api/v1/book/list/`). There are four sub-groups of API endpoints: `Book`, `Section`, `Version` and `Content`. 

| Group | URL |
